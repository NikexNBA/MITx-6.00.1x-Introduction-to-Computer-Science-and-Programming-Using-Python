Coursework for 6.00.1x

Problem Set 1 - Python Basics
1 - Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s
2 - Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s
3 - Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order

Problem Set 2 - Simple Programs
1 - Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum 
    monthly payment required by the credit card company each month
2 - Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit 
    card balance within 12 months
3 - Well then, how can we calculate a more accurate fixed monthly payment than we did in Problem 2 without 
    running into the problem of slow code? We can make this program run faster using a technique introduced 
    in lecture - bisection search!
    
Problem Set 3 - Structured Types
Hangman - In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out 
          an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer
          
Problem Set 4 - Good Programming Practices
Scrabble - 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. 
            Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each 
            valid word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word
